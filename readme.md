# Sinatra Quickstart

This is a bare-bones set of files for getting started with a basic Sinatra application.

If you want a slightly more-involved setup (with Open Auth authentication), check out [https://github.com/charliepark/omniauth-for-sinatra](https://github.com/charliepark/omniauth-for-sinatra).

The ["Getting Started" guide](http://www.sinatrarb.com/intro) for Sinatra is the best place to look for more.
